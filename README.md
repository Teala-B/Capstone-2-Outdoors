# Enjoy the Outdoors Website

A basic website, consisting of three simple pages, made with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and a large focus on JavaScript.

## Home Page

The home page starts with a nav bar at the top.

_Navigation bar spans across **ALL** pages and highlights the current page the user is on._


Next is a video that displays a walk/hike through a nature trail.

_It functions the same as any other video._

The middle of the page gives insight on what's to come on the next pages

_There is a section for the national parks page **AND** the mountains page._

Each section includes a button that links to the corresponding page

For additional information there is a goal section

Lastly there is a footer section that contains basic information about the website

The next page contains national parks of different types from different states

The page consists of two filters, state and type, that can be used simultaneously or not at all
![National Parks](images/read-me-parks-page.JPG)
_The selectors/filters are on the left and the corresponding parks are displayed on the right._

![State Filter](images/read-me-state.JPG)
_You **CAN** filter by **ONLY** the state._

![Type Filter](images/read-me-type.JPG)
_You **CAN ALSO** filter by **ONLY** the park type._

Adding the different detials was for each park was a challenge in and of itself, however adding the site aspect was very interesting.
Every park did not have a website link so I needed to filter through both an array and object, using the key, to see if there was a website.
If it did then it would be added on to the corresponding park section.
